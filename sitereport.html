            <p> Namaste! My name is Rinzi Sherpa. I am the student of NAMI college(1st year).
                My course is BSc(Hons) Computing. <br>
                This assignment was given us nearly a month ago.This was our first assignment.<br>
                This assignment contains navigation bar with Home page, portfolio page, contact page and workexperience page.
                This website contains simple HTML and CSS codes. It took almost 1 month to complete this website.
                While creating this page, lot of problems were faced. It was hard to make the portfolio page. 
                This website contains grid, animations and some text fonts.

                The main problem was with the git. I was not able to figure out the problem. whenever I try to push the commit
                it shows error after many attempts I was able to push and commit  but I didn't find it in my repositry.
                I was not able to solve the problem so I just created the new reposetry and uploaded all the files in that reposetry.
